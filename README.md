# flashcards backend
The RESTFful API for my flashcard website, made with FastAPI.

## What is this?
This is mainly intended to be a way for me to learn more advanced Python (I have been learning Python for some time now, but you know what tutorial hell is like) by creating a website that can create flashcards, and allows you to practice said flashcards.

## Libraries
